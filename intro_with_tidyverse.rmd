# Filter rows: Create a new data frame that includes only employees who work in the "IT" department.

print(employees_IT)

#Select columns: Create a new data frame that includes only the Name and Salary columns.
employees_name_salary  <- employees %>% select(Name, Salary)
print(employees_name_salary)

# Add a new column: Add a new column called Bonus that calculates a 10% bonus for each employee based on their salary.
employees <- employees %>% mutate(Bonus = Salary*0.1)
print(employees)

#Sort rows: Sort the employees data frame by Salary in descending order.
employees <- employees %>% arrange(desc(Salary))

# Summarize data: Calculate the average salary for each department.
summary_df <- employees %>% 
  group_by(Department) %>%
  summarize(mean_salary = mean(Salary))
print(summary_df)

#Extra 1: Advanced Data Manipulation
#Group and summarize: Group the data by Department and calculate the total salary expenditure for each department.
#Filter and mutate: Create a new data frame that includes only employees older than 30 and adds a column called Experience that assumes each employee has Age - 25 years of experience.
employees_over30 <- employees %>% filter(Age > 30)
employees_over30 <- employees_over30 %>% mutate(Experience = Age - 25)

# Extra 2: Challenge
# Combine operations: Create a new data frame that includes employees from the "HR" department, adds a Bonus column (10% of salary), and sorts the data by Bonus in descending order.
employees_HR <- employees %>% 
                filter(Department == "HR") %>%
                mutate(Bonus = Salary * 0.1) %>%
                arrange(desc(Bonus))

# Visualize data: Use ggplot2 to create a bar plot showing the total salary expenditure by department.
exp_department <- employees %>% 
  group_by(Department) %>%
  summarize(mean_salary = sum(Salary))

ggplot(exp_department, mapping = aes(x=Department, y = mean_salary)) +
